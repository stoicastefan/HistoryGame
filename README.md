## Tools used for the game development
HistoryGame is a web application built with Python, Flask, JavaScript, and Flask_SQLAlchemy. Python and Flask were used for the server-side, while JavaScript was used for the client-side. Flask_SQLAlchemy was used for interacting with the database. HTML and CSS were used for the project to structure and style the web pages. HTML provided the backbone of the pages, while CSS enabled the creation of the design.
